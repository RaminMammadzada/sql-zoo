```sql
SELECT name, population, area
FROM world

For South America show population in millions and GDP in billions both to 2 decimal places.
Millions and billions

```

11.Greece has capital Athens.
Each of the strings 'Greece', and 'Athens' has 6 characters.
Show the name and capital where the name and the capital have the same number of characters.
You can use the LENGTH function to find the number of characters in a string
```sql
SELECT name, capital
FROM world WHERE LENGTH(name) = LENGTH(capital);
```

12.The capital of Sweden is Stockholm. Both words start with the letter 'S'.
Show the name and the capital where the first letters of each match. Don't include countries where the name and the capital are the same word.
You can use the function LEFT to isolate the first character.
You can use <> as the NOT EQUALS operator.
```sql
SELECT name, capital
FROM world
WHERE LEFT(name,1) = LEFT(capital,1) EXCEPT SELECT name, capital
FROM world WHERE name = capital;
```

13.Equatorial Guinea and Dominican Republic have all of the vowels (a e i o u) in the name. They don't count because they have more than one word in the name.
Find the country that has all the vowels and no spaces in its name.
You can use the phrase name NOT LIKE '%a%' to exclude characters from your results.
The query shown misses countries like Bahamas and Belarus because they contain at least one 'a'
```sql
SELECT name
   FROM world
WHERE name LIKE '%a%' AND
      name LIKE '%e%' AND
      name LIKE '%i%' AND
