2.Show the name and the population for 'Sweden', 'Norway' and 'Denmark'.

```sql
SELECT name, population FROM world
WHERE name IN ('Sweden', 'Norway', 'Denmark');
```

3.Show the country and the area for countries with an area between 200,000
and 250,000.

```sql
SELECT name, area FROM world
WHERE area BETWEEN 200000 AND 250000;
```

## 1. SELECT Name

SELECT name, population, area
FROM world

9.Show the name and population in millions and the GDP in billions for the countries of the continent 'South America'. Use the ROUND function to show the values to two decimal places.
For South America show population in millions and GDP in billions both to 2 decimal places.
Millions and billions

FROM world
WHERE continent LIKE 'South America';
```

```
11.Greece has capital Athens.
Each of the strings 'Greece', and 'Athens' has 6 characters.
Show the name and capital where the name and the capital have the same number of characters.
You can use the LENGTH function to find the number of characters in a string
```sql
SELECT name, capital
FROM world WHERE LENGTH(name) = LENGTH(capital);
```
12.The capital of Sweden is Stockholm. Both words start with the letter 'S'.
Show the name and the capital where the first letters of each match. Don't include countries where the name and the capital are the same word.
You can use the function LEFT to isolate the first character.
You can use <> as the NOT EQUALS operator.
```sql
SELECT name, capital
FROM world
WHERE LEFT(name,1) = LEFT(capital,1) EXCEPT SELECT name, capital
FROM world WHERE name = capital;
```
13.Equatorial Guinea and Dominican Republic have all of the vowels (a e i o u) in the name. They don't count because they have more than one word in the name.
Find the country that has all the vowels and no spaces in its name.
You can use the phrase name NOT LIKE '%a%' to exclude characters from your results.
The query shown misses countries like Bahamas and Belarus because they contain at least one 'a'
```sql
SELECT name
   FROM world
WHERE name LIKE '%a%' AND
      name LIKE '%e%' AND
      name LIKE '%i%' AND
      name LIKE '%o%' AND
      name LIKE '%u%' AND
      name NOT LIKE '% %';
