# Microverse Databases -> SQL Project

The goal of this project is to put into practice SQL queries using the online resource [SQL Zoo](http://sqlzoo.net).

[SQL Zoo](http://sqlzoo.net) is one of the few resources online that actually lets you build and run queries against existing tables. Each tutorial will show you a table and then have you run queries against it to answer specific questions.

## Solutions I proposed to all of the problems in every tutorial

0. [SELECT Basics](/SELECT_basics)
1. [SELECT Name](/SELECT_name)
2. [SELECT From World](/SELECT_from_World)
3. [SELECT From Nobel](/SELECT_from_Nobel_Tutorial)
4. [SELECT within SELECT Tutorial](/SELECT_within_SELECT_Tutorial)
5. [SUM and COUNT](/SUM_and_COUNT)
6. [JOIN](JOIN)
7. [More JOIN Operations](/More_JOIN_Operations)
8. [Using Null](/Using_Null)
9. [Numeric_Examples](/Numeric_Examples)
10. [Window_function](/Window_function)
11. [COVID_19](/COVID_19)
11. [Self_join](/Self_join)
